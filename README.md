# Starboard AI: A React-based Location Analysis Application

This README provides documentation for Starboard AI, a React application designed for location analysis.  Based on the provided code snippets, it appears to utilize various UI components, react-query for data fetching, and potentially integrates with external services for location data (the specifics are not fully clear from the limited code).

## 1. Project Title and Short Description

**Starboard AI:** A React application for comprehensive location analysis.

This project provides a user interface for exploring location-specific data, including demographics, land sales, proximity insights, and zoning information.


## 2. Project Overview

Starboard AI offers a rich set of tools for analyzing locations.  Key features include:

* **Interactive Location Map:**  Visualizes location data on a map (implementation details not shown).
* **Demographics Analysis:** Displays demographic information for a given location.
* **Land Sales Data:** Presents historical and current land sales data.
* **Proximity Insights:** Provides insights into nearby points of interest or relevant data points.
* **Zoning Information:** Shows zoning regulations and restrictions for a specific area.
* **Customizable UI Components:** Leverages a library of reusable UI components (buttons, forms, dialogs, etc., as shown in `src/components/ui`).

## 4. Prerequisites

* Node.js and npm (or yarn)
* A suitable code editor (VS Code recommended)


## 5. Installation Guide

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/harshkasat/starboard-ai.git`
2. Navigate to the project directory: `cd starboard-ai`
3. Install dependencies: `npm install` or `yarn install`


## 7. Usage Examples

The application's main entry point is `src/App.tsx`.  It uses React Router for navigation and `react-query` for data fetching:

```typescript
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";
import Index from "./pages/Index";
import NotFound from "./pages/NotFound";

const queryClient = new QueryClient();

const App = () => (
  <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Index />} />
        <Route path="*" element={<NotFound />} />
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  </QueryClientProvider>
);

export default App;
```

This shows a basic routing setup.  Specific usage of location analysis features requires examining the components within the `src/components/location-analysis` directory, which are not fully detailed in the provided code snippets.


## 8. Project Architecture

The project uses a component-based architecture with React.  The UI components are located in `src/components/ui`.  Location analysis components reside in `src/components/location-analysis`.  The application uses React Router for navigation and `react-query` for data management.  Styling is handled using Tailwind CSS (as indicated by `postcss.config.js`).

**Missing Information:**  The provided code snippets give a high-level overview of the project's structure and dependencies.  However, crucial details about data sources, API interactions, specific features, and testing are missing.  A complete README would require a more thorough examination of the entire codebase.
